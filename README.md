## Meta

Author: Chunliang Mu

Requrie python 3.10+ (since I am using the | operator for type hints)

Basically what it does
is to copy, timestamp & gzip files
from your specified folder to another folder,
and save a list of your file structure,
so you can copy them to wherever you please
while retaining a record of version history.
